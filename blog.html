                      <p>
                        QR codes seems to be the new mammoth in transactions
                        nowadays within this Covid-19 pandemic era. QR codes,
                        short for "Quick Response codes", involves the use of
                        bar codes that are read by mobile phones to complete
                        transactions in terms of digital payments. The rise of
                        QR code technology has been led by the global pandemic
                        as a way of avoiding one on one contact. In developed
                        and developing economies, different government-run
                        systems are switching to technology as a key front to
                        solve the Covid-19 pandemic. Those black and white
                        patterns are finally taking off. Let me dive into the
                        three major sector shift of the technology which are
                        Hotel, Health and Travel:

                    <div>
                      <h2 class="text-hoverColor text-lg">Hotel</h2>
                      <p>
                        With the current pandemic, most businesses are
                        interlocking the technology with their business models.
                        Hotels now have digital menus where you scan for your
                        menu replacing old traditional ordering menus. The
                        software tool has made the paper format to become
                        obsolete. Perusing menus has now become a thing of the
                        past. Moreover, distribution of information between
                        hotels and client has become more customer centric.
                        Safety procedures and protocols are being laid down
                        through use of QR codes. In my opinion, the hotel
                        business seems to have taken a dynamic shift on
                        transactions for purposes of coping with the new norms
                        globally.

                    <div class="more-article">
                      <div>
                        <h2 class="text-hoverColor text-lg">Travel</h2>
                        <p>
                          Travel regulations have also changed and are using QR
                          codes as proof of healthy travelers moving from one
                          country to another. Physical exchange, a major
                          contributor to the pandemic has forced travel agencies
                          to rethink their strategies on customer journey
                          interaction. Tap, scan and go is their new slogan. For
                          instance we are no longer seeing queues within the
                          travel network due to the adaptability of a quick and
                          efficient processing system known as the QR code
                          system. Moreover tracking data has evolved companies
                          to get to know user interactions on their platforms
                          which in turn give information used for revenue
                          uptakes within their sales model.

                        <p>
                          Digital health has revolutionized the health sector in
                          the last one year since the pandemic erupted. One way
                          that health providers are relaying information is
                          through use of health applications or so called
                          "health apps". The rise of QR codes arise in transfer
                          of data from health providers to the end users. We
                          have seen recently in the health industry adoption of
                          digital certificates which help users evaluate their
                          health status. This transfer of data is led through Qr
                          code technology. Also the digital health codes which
                          analyze ones history travel to determine whether they
                          are a threat to people are a proof that the technology
                          works. In terms of security issues the users want
                          health apps that are compatible with companies that
                          let them keep their own data.

                        <h2 class="text-hoverColor text-xl">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                          There is no doubt that the three sectors have led to
                          an up growth on QR code technology. Each sector is
                          affected differently but the technological process is
                          the same. Furthermore having been a witness to the
                          surge of covid-19 pandemic, I do believe that QR codes
                          will be the future of transactions since the
                          innovation is gaining traction at fast pace. Lastly
                          new technologies are led by shift in market changes
                          and in this case Covid-19 pandemic is leading the
                          market to QR code system hence the uptake.

                      <p>
                        Tweaking traditional concepts of doing things has been
                        replaced by technology but at what point does monopoly
                        come in?.According to Wikipedia Monopolisation refers to
                        attempts by a dominant firm or group of relatively large
                        firms to maintain or increase market control through
                        various anti-competitive practices such as predatory
                        pricing, pre-emption of facilities, and foreclosure of
                        competition.In the 21 st century technology seems to be
                        in control of each and every sector in the world. One
                        cannot do anything without being tech centric and that
                        makes them a democracy in their own making. With their
                        outstanding performance in the stock exchange how far
                        before government systems say they have had it.At what
                        point does monopolization of tech companies become a
                        problem?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the last decade tech industries have been thriving on
                        cut throat profits using data analytics tools to wipe
                        out competition.With huge market scopes their power
                        seems to be unbeatable.These Companies are a buy and
                        halt process when it comes to competition.They buy their
                        competition and no innovations forms further leading to
                        unfair marketing practices.A company like Fcebook is an
                        example of a monopoly status symbol.After their
                        acquiring of watsapp while still owning messenger leaves
                        no room for competition on messaging platfroms.These
                        companies seem to practice a lot of unethical practices
                        just to stay in the market.A deep study into them and
                        you will find their competitors are in a downward spiral
                        of demand.

                        A controversy last rose when the big four tech giants
                        Google ,Amazon,Facebook and Apple were subjected to a
                        white house judiciary committee led by the democrats in
                        Congress to explain predicaments of monopolisation.The
                        companies were accused of having too much power like the
                        oil and rail industry in the hey days of the 18th
                        century.The four CEOS who run these tech giants denied
                        allegations of monopolisation and were heavily fined for
                        their lack of ethics.

                        New industry territories like artificial intelligence
                        have been a favorite for these companies where one is
                        able to predict data leaving their rival competitors in
                        the wind.As stated in built-in beta, a company that
                        provides AI services, Artificial intelligence is a
                        branch of computer science concerned with building smart
                        machines capable of performing tasks that typically
                        require human intelligence. This definition clearly
                        tells you that tasks that are human oriented are being
                        replaced by machines.The monopolistic companies have
                        formed a habit of buying companies that offer these
                        services and collect data that is used by the human
                        community making the market completely predictable to
                        them

                        Their related industries in social media,e commerce and
                        advertising have basically fallen off their perches when
                        it comes to market share and revenue. A continued
                        downward fall has led to lawsuits front, left and
                        center.These Artificial intelligence companies have
                        structured algorithms which can predict anything by
                        using data points which leads to easy access of wins in

                        How to deal with these companies
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        To come up with a solution we have to uphold anti trust
                        laws to curb inequalities in the market.Having more
                        funding for anti trust law agencies should be a
                        priority.It gives these agencies an easy go ahead to
                        deal with monoplisation.If we have a systematic pursuit
                        of competition becomes democratic. They should also
                        break down these companies to structural operations and
                        dissaprove competition on companies that are comparable
                        to them.This gives an opportunity for other industry
                        players an access to the market share or in tech terms
                        as they call it "access to users". Avoidance of mergers
                        and acquisitions in the same industry for tech companies
                        should be prohibited.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This will allow a fair share game within the
                        market.Prices also should be regulated.The cost of a
                        service depends on the average cost ,the total cost
                        divided by the output.If competition becomes unethical
                        monopolists usually determine market prices.Regulation
                        on pricing should be put forth to discourage tech
                        companies from taking advantage of how to price their
                        products and services.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To avert biasness they should be requested to scale down
                        their business models to maintain better relations in
                        the market.If their business models predict the market
                        competition becomes obsolete leaving their rivals
                        hanging in the noose. Limitation of advertising of these
                        companies should also be suggested.We should not allow
                        too much advert dominace on these digital
                        platforms.Their should be a limit as to how much they
                        can allowed to share adverts.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Share of data to small companies should also be a
                        priority.If these tech giants share some data with other
                        small players they have a chance for market share
                        too.Interporebility of data should be a key component
                        especially to social media platforms when trying to
                        reduce monopolisation.Sharing of data reduces dominance.
                        A drift into small players gaining a piece of pie in the
                        tech industry leads to better levels of competition.
                      </p>
                      <h2 class="text-mainColor">Conclusion</h2>
                      <p>
                        We can clearly conclude that monopolization will
                        continue if government systems all over the world do not
                        put up stringent policies to curb the process.For a
                        systematic pursuit, all companies should be given a fair
                        share gain in the market. Future should not be
                        determined by a few jargons in the market. As it is the
                        nature of history to repeat itself, monopolies should be
                        broken and global collaboration should come into play.
