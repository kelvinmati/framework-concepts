                      <p>
                        QR codes seems to be the new mammoth in transactions
                        nowadays within this Covid-19 pandemic era. QR codes,
                        short for "Quick Response codes", involves the use of
                        bar codes that are read by mobile phones to complete
                        transactions in terms of digital payments. The rise of
                        QR code technology has been led by the global pandemic
                        as a way of avoiding one on one contact. In developed
                        and developing economies, different government-run
                        systems are switching to technology as a key front to
                        solve the Covid-19 pandemic. Those black and white
                        patterns are finally taking off. Let me dive into the
                        three major sector shift of the technology which are
                        Hotel, Health and Travel:
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      <h2 class="text-hoverColor text-lg">Hotel</h2>
                      <p>
                        With the current pandemic, most businesses are
                        interlocking the technology with their business models.
                        Hotels now have digital menus where you scan for your
                        menu replacing old traditional ordering menus. The
                        software tool has made the paper format to become
                        obsolete. Perusing menus has now become a thing of the
                        past. Moreover, distribution of information between
                        hotels and client has become more customer centric.
                        Safety procedures and protocols are being laid down
                        through use of QR codes. In my opinion, the hotel
                        business seems to have taken a dynamic shift on
                        transactions for purposes of coping with the new norms
                        globally.

                    <div class="more-article">
                      <div>
                        <h2 class="text-hoverColor text-lg">Travel</h2>
                        <p>
                          Travel regulations have also changed and are using QR
                          codes as proof of healthy travelers moving from one
                          country to another. Physical exchange, a major
                          contributor to the pandemic has forced travel agencies
                          to rethink their strategies on customer journey
                          interaction. Tap, scan and go is their new slogan. For
                          instance we are no longer seeing queues within the
                          travel network due to the adaptability of a quick and
                          efficient processing system known as the QR code
                          system. Moreover tracking data has evolved companies
                          to get to know user interactions on their platforms
                          which in turn give information used for revenue
                          uptakes within their sales model.

                        <p>
                          Digital health has revolutionized the health sector in
                          the last one year since the pandemic erupted. One way
                          that health providers are relaying information is
                          through use of health applications or so called
                          "health apps". The rise of QR codes arise in transfer
                          of data from health providers to the end users. We
                          have seen recently in the health industry adoption of
                          digital certificates which help users evaluate their
                          health status. This transfer of data is led through Qr
                          code technology. Also the digital health codes which
                          analyze ones history travel to determine whether they
                          are a threat to people are a proof that the technology
                          works. In terms of security issues the users want
                          health apps that are compatible with companies that
                          let them keep their own data.

                        <h2 class="text-hoverColor text-xl">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                          There is no doubt that the three sectors have led to
                          an up growth on QR code technology. Each sector is
                          affected differently but the technological process is
                          the same. Furthermore having been a witness to the
                          surge of covid-19 pandemic, I do believe that QR codes
                          will be the future of transactions since the
                          innovation is gaining traction at fast pace. Lastly
                          new technologies are led by shift in market changes
                          and in this case Covid-19 pandemic is leading the
                          market to QR code system hence the uptake.

                      <p>
                        Msook basically means mud schools out of Kenya. With
                        todays affordable housing projects we came to realize
                        that there are some primary schools in Kenya still made
                        of mud.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        These conditions are not fit for education hence
                        creating awareness of the #msook campaign. School kids
                        are affected by these environment conditions hence we
                        believe not just providing good education but also
                        providing good environment for efficiency of education
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In prior to the big 4 agenda affordable housing is part
                        of vision 2030 hence creation of the #Msook campaign.If
                        realignment is done government and well wishers will
                        consider and improve environmental conditions for
                        education within Kenya as a whole.
